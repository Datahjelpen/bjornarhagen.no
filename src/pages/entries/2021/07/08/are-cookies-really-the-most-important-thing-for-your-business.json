We use cookies to track you!!! It's very very important for us that you allow us to track you, please. \n\n> Ok great, no thanks Telenor. I'll just head over to Altibox instead\n\n![Altibox mandatory cookie consent screen](/images/entries/2021/07/cookies/altibox.png)\n> Ah ... maybe not after all.\n\nLet's look at how it can (and should) be done, shall we?\n\n![1&1 website](/images/entries/2021/07/cookies/one-and-one.png)\n![Vodafone website](/images/entries/2021/07/cookies/vodafone.png)\n> Can you believe it? Websites in EU with no cookie consent screen? How can this be?\n\n## How can I make a website without cookie consent?\n\nThis part is pretty complex and technical, so bear with me here.\n Here is an exhaustive list outlining how you can make your website without a cookie consent:\n\n1. Don't spy on people\n\nOk, got it? I know it can be a lot to take in at once, so I recommend letting it all sink in for a while before reading it once more.\n\n### No but really, how?\n\nReally, just don't use tracking software.\n\nIn the case of Vodafone and 1&1, it seems they have some smart people who realized that they sell phones and mobile data subscriptions. They made this is their number one priority and de-prioritized spying on people.\n\nIt's actually possible to make a good product/service without spying on people. Just get your priorities straight."
